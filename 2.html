<h2>airjordan 2</h2>
The success of the Air Jordan I encouraged Nike to release a new Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season.
Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy.
The Air Jordan II introduced better cushioning with a polyurethane midsole and a full length encapsulated Nike air bubble for maximum comfort.
The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper.
The Air Jordan II originally retailed at $100 and was released from 1986 to 1987. The shoe later re-released in 1994, 2004–2005, 2008, 2010, 2014–2018.
